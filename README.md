Smart-Button
============

A survey of frameworks and web component polylibs to implement a simple button that can be tied to an asynchronous task.

To do
=====
 - ~~Refactor code to use custom events to communicate state, rather than promises, in order to require binding or weird global work-arounds.~~
 - ~~Clean up event listeners on destruction of elements.~~
 - Update Polymer, AngularJS, and React examples to use custom events.
